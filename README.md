# Language Detection Model

## Overview

This project implements a language detection model using Naive Bayes classification. The model is trained to predict the language of given sentences. The implementation is done using the Streamlit framework for creating a simple and interactive web application.

## Model Details

- **Classifier**: Naive Bayes
- **Vectorization**: Count Vectorizer
- **Label Encoding**: Label Encoder
